# Fast Color Generator ![Build](https://github.com/UltraCakeBakery/FastBooleanArray/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

Fast Color Generator is a high-performance JavaScript library for generating pseudo-random colors efficiently. This utility uses a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) for deterministic color generation, making it ideal for applications requiring random or seeded colors, such as data visualization, gaming, and procedural art.

## Features

- **High-Performance**: Efficient color generation with a minimal memory footprint (Up to 2x faster!)
- **Predictability and Seedable**: Deterministic color generation based on a seed value, allowing you to generate the same sequence of colors consistently.
- **Versatile API**: Easy-to-use getter and setter methods for hex and RGB values.
- **Lightweight**: No external dependencies, perfect for high-performance use cases.
- **Type-safe and tested**: Written in typescript and has a 100% test coverage through vitest unit testing.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install fast-color-generator --save
pnpm install fast-color-generator --save
```

---

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the Fast Color Generator:

```javascript
import FastColorGenerator from "fast-color-generator";

// Create a new generator instance with an optional seed
const generator = new FastColorGenerator(12345);

// Generate the next color
generator.next();

// Get the current color
console.log(generator.hex); // Output: #3a2f1c (example)
console.log(generator.rgb); // Output: { r: 58, g: 47, b: 28 }

// Set a specific color
generator.hex = "#ff8800";
generator.rgb = { r: 255, g: 136, b: 0 };
```

---

## API

### `new FastColorGenerator(seed?: number)`

Creates a new Fast Color Generator instance. If no seed is provided, the current date as an integer is used.

- **Parameters**:
  - `seed` (number): A 32-bit integer used as the starting state.

---

### `next()`

Advances the internal state to generate the next color.

---

### `hex: string`

Gets or sets the current color as a hexadecimal string in the format `#rrggbb`.

- **Getter Example**:

  ```javascript
  console.log(generator.hex); // "#3a2f1c"
  ```

- **Setter Example**:
  ```javascript
  generator.hex = "#00ff00";
  ```

---

### `rgb: { r: number; g: number; b: number }`

Gets or sets the current color as an RGB object.

- **Getter Example**:

  ```javascript
  console.log(generator.rgb); // { r: 58, g: 47, b: 28 }
  ```

- **Setter Example**:
  ```javascript
  generator.rgb = { r: 200, g: 150, b: 100 };
  ```

| 100,000          | 12.48264             | 6.02200                   |
| 1,000,000        | 123.56793            | 58.55502                  |
| 16,777,216       | 2053.39782           | 946.79718                 |

The Fast Color Generator is more efficient for large-scale color generation, outperforming even the most simple random color generator implementation significantly as the dataset grows. However, due to the initialization cost of its constructor, it should be used with caution for small-scale operations.
